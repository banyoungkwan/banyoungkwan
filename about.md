# Ban Youngkwan, Youngkwan Ban's page.

My name is Youngkwan Ban. I go by Ban. I know, it is little bit weird to call someone’s family name without formality. But I prefer that way. Ban has been my nickname for long time, because Ban is quite rare. You know, you can encounter Kim, Lee, or Park quite easily; but not Ban.

I had choices. At least I believe it was my call to choose to be called as Ban. There would be other choices: i might insist you to call me Youngkwan; maybe with little hyphen between, so it makes it a little bit easier to you. I can be just Young, using my first phoneme as if that only sound is my name. Maybe I could’ve used Andrew, or Andre with noble French accent, which is my old baptismal name, received when I was the age of five.

Naming yourself is your apparatus to reality. It interchanges, back and forth, yourself and the outside. Ban is better, I really prefer; sometimes, I didn’t have the choice. Pronouncing my full name, letter by letter is frustrating. I was Youngtwan Bao, two months ago. I was Mr Kwan around eight months ago. I was Yi; I used to be YK for many times I need to get drycleaning services or restaurant reservations. You don’t know how the emigrant, whose mother tongue is not English or European, get easily frustrated when we spell strange alphabets over the phone.

So I never am the one who I really want to be, maybe? In exchange, listen to this, now I ended up to be really good at this, “So my name is Bravo, Alpha, November that’s for my last name. And my first name is "YankeeOscarUniformNovemberGolfKiloWhiskeyAlphaNovember.” Lots of November, huh? But still, I kept finding something like Youngtwan Bao in my bills.
