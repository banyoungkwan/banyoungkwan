## Hello!
<p></p> 
My name is Youngkwan Ban. I go by Ban. I know, it is little bit weird to call someone’s family name. But I prefer this way. 

I had choices. At least I believe it had. I could ask you to call me Youngkwan; maybe Young-kwan, so non-Korean speakers could pronounce more like Korean (luckyly, my name do not have “ㄹ", pronounced like "L" or "R” in Korean language). I could be just Young, using my first phoneme. Maybe I could use Andrew, or _Andre_ with the noble French accent, which is my old baptismal name, received when I was the age of five.

Not always I have this choice. I was Youngtwan Bao, two months ago. I was Mr Kwan around eight months ago. I was Yi; I used to be YK (Yay-Kay) for many times I need to get dry-cleaning or restaurant reservations. You don’t know how the emigrant, whose mother tongue is not English or European, get easily frustrated when we spell strange alphabets over the phone.

So I never am the one who I really want to be, maybe? In exchange, listen to this, now I ended up to be really good at this, “So my name is Bravo, Alpha, November that’s for my last name. And my first name is "Yankee-Oscar-Uniform-November-Golf-Kilo-Whiskey-Alpha-November.” 

Well, nevermind. Doesn't matter who I am. This is a personal blog anyway.
