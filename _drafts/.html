<p>“Catch only what you’ve thrown yourself, all is<br />
mere skill and little gain;<br />
but when you’re suddenly the catcher of a ball<br />
thrown by an eternal partner<br />
with accurate and measured swing<br />
towards you, to your center, in an arch<br />
from the great bridgebuilding of God:<br />
why catching then becomes a power—<br />
not yours, a world’s.<br />
—Rainer Maria Rilke”</p>
<p>Excerpt From: Gadamer, Hans-Georg. “Truth and Method.” iBooks.</p>
