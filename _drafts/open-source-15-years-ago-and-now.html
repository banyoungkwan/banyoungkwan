<p>I remember when I heard about Linux for first time. In 1999, I was reading a newspaper and found an advertisement for a “Linux computer.” Around that time, several mid-range computer manufacture companies released a series of products with Linux as the operating system (OS), and they were relatively successful. Soon, many people began to talk about Linux as if we all should use it instead of what we had used, which was primarily MS Windows</p>
<p>.<a href="http://sheeplesssleepless.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-06-at-10-32-05-pm.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-175231812" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screen-shot-2014-09-06-at-10-32-05-pm.png?w=294" alt="Screen Shot 2014-09-06 at 10.32.05 PM" width="294" height="300" /></a>  </p>
<p>(image: Newspaper article - "Penguin" is coming over the "windows" (Donga Ilbo, 1999-02-25))</p>
<p> The arrival of Linux in mainstream computer-market of South Korea seemed to be an issue, which might blow the monopoly by Microsoft. And the possibility is not just comes from the strength of Linux, but the circumstance outside the market. It created buzz not not only because users did not want to pay 100,000-200,000 KRW (appox. $100-200) for their operating system. The operation systems were also definitely linked to particular nationalism, confronting global economic crisis. In 1997, two years before the Linux computer, South Korea requested International Monetary Fund (IMF) aid because of its economic crisis, which may not have only been caused by the Koreans. I remember that mass demonstrations were held and that the protesters boycotted foreign movies in the theaters. “815 Cola”, the anti-Coke (from U.S.), launched. Youngsters patched the national flag over the foreign brand. Between Windows and Linux, the tension seems to be similar as binary; the former symbolized the accumulation of (evil) international capital, and the latter acted as the enemy of the former. Therefore, Linux appealed to South Korea during its economic crisis. This was not just evidenced in public opinion. The Korean government announced that being a “Linux programmer/expert” would be one of the most promising jobs in “new millennium” (<a title="[21세기 유망직종]리눅스전문가-김치연구가에 도전" href="http://news.donga.com/3/all/19991213/7492203/1" target="_blank">Link: Korean</a>). Many public sectors were encouraged to use open-source software and attempt to develop their own programs. So, for users in South Korea in 1999, using Linux was akin to protesting the wave of so-called neo-liberalism and globalization.</p>

<p>Even after that, it seemed that Microsoft remained on top. A few months later, new reports revealed some Linux PCs by mid-sized manufactures were not purely made for Linux, paradoxically. If someone bought one, a technician would visit the home with the PC, set up the components, erase Linux system from new hard-drive, and install an illegal copy of Microsoft Windows 98. Microsoft in Korea soon realized the issue and threatened those companies to make them stop selling fake Linux machines. Otherwise, Microsoft would not provide their products. This is only one case of the many violations of intellectual property in South Korea since then. Soon, though, the so-called Linux computer vanished from the market.</p>
<p> Now that I have given some background, I can get into the real purpose of the blog. I want to talk about what happened to Linux—where has it been and where will it will go? In “Two-Bits,” Ketly (2008) proposes that geeks are a recursive public “that is vitally concerned with the material and practical maintenance and modification of the technical, legal, practical, and conceptual means of its own existence as a public” (p.3). Then he goes on to say that a “geek is a collective independent of other forms of constituted power and is capable of speaking to existing forms of power through the production of actually existing alternatives.” According to this conceptualization, it is reasonable to believe that geeks are performing philanthropic acts. They are participating in various projects and are not being extrinsically rewarded much, if at all, in comparison to what they would receive if they choose to work in the industry. It was their intention to give up on the traditional ways of doing things and use their knowledge to solve problems that are not directly related to their personal life.</p>
<p> Ketly also said that “Free Software is no longer only about software; it exemplifies a more general reorientation of power and knowledge” (p.2). However, I view this “reorientation” with suspicious. Is it present? Has it not surrendered to the pre-existing order yet? And, most importantly, are geeks, who work inside this practice, in agreement with this reorientation with full confidence?</p>
<p> Kelty said geeks are “not capitalists or technocrats” (p.35). Okay, then, who are they? Can we call them communists? Or anarchists? I assume some are, but we cannot group all the participants in this open-source practice into one category. I am suspicious that the author is somehow trapped by idealizing the research objects. They may be a recursive public when they are inside Github, but their relation with reality shouldn’t be the same as 15 years ago. While some may contribute to geek culture with a pure mind, others are building their resumes by saying “<a title="I got my job at (big investment bank) because of my open-source work" href="http://www.quora.com/Does-contributing-to-open-source-projects-look-good-on-a-resume" target="_blank">I got my job at (big investment bank) because of my open-source work</a>”.</p>
<p> Geeks, in my opinion, do what they want to do. It is possible that some are freedom fighters against dominant enterprises and some are entrepreneurs. Some seek ways to beat Microsoft, and some seek to be another Bill Gates. Some are practicing their skill because they want to overcome challenges and be rewarded by the achievement itself. This is like the development of internet, which originated from a military-industrial complex, and later served so many purposes, which include anti-military-industrial complex movements. The original idea behind the project does not explain the current status of the project, and I feel Kelty misinterpreted that. South Koreans in 1999 saw the rise of Linux with that perspective. Decades later, they managed to create the Samsung Galaxy S5, which is making a huge profit with its worldwide success and is the same exploitation from another side of the Earth. Therefore, the result of the project, based on where it began, cannot be predicted.</p>
<p> Open-source software is, however, widespread, and its impact is undeniable. It is literally everywhere and is more visible now than in any other moments of computing history. I even read these books with an application named “<a title="Koreader:Github" href="https://github.com/koreader/koreader" target="_blank">KoReader</a>” for my ebook reader that I had downloaded from Github. This application offers more options than the original operation system and is based on the Linux system. Also, many of the webpages I access frequently that use Firefox are probably hosted by Apache. Inside some commercial software, there are also codes from open-source software. I don’t want to want to denounce the impact from either open-source or free software. I understand that free software has shaped the current net environment, which would be far different without it.</p>
<p> I don’t want to argue here as neo-liberalism-deterministic view. For fairly enough times, certain political side kept talk about one ‘-ism’ as if it explains all the symptoms of contemporary society. I don’t believe that; and I don’t want to talk about this at this page. I am skeptical, however, about whether this can be used as a tool for social change. In his book, Kelty equates the Harbermasian public sphere with geek culture. Such a move can only be approved when the basic principle of knowledge creation in our society has transformed into that of geeks’. However, what does the death of Aron Swartz tell us? (Link) Wiki edit-wars are fun, but do they really change the norm of society? Ensuring more participation does not guarantee more subversive knowledge production. For me, it seems too slow and way too dangerous to rely on this quasi-Harbermasian model of social change. The expansions of free-software service, not as open-source project, such as Google Office or Evernote, may endanger the ultimate the aim to make change, as the interest will be aggregated into the currently existing power-knowledge structure.</p>
