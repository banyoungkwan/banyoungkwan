<p>Seabear : The Ghost That Carried Us Away (2007)<br />09. Sailor's Blues
<p>
<p>I saw the lion on the elephant's back<br />(Crawling forever)<br />I heard your name in a book<br />Saw your face in a map
<p>And now I hear your name every where I go<br />But I'm the quiet, polar, quiet, bear<br />Making blankets for the dead
<p>And after you make up with the ghost<br />Do stop the blood running from your nose
<p>And the snow is falling hard down<br />On this old window<br />I thought that summer was near<br />But what do I know?
<p>The taste on your lips<br />The lead in your eyelids<br />The sea under the boat<br />My hands in your raincoat
<p>When I shoot this rock<br />But get the sailor's blues in a maze<br />(Try again)
<p>I think I'll sleep in this ghost town <br />For a while if you don't mind<br />(Go unpack your bag)</p></p></p></p></p></p>
