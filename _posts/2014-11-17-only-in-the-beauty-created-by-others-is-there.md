title: "Only in the beauty created\nby others is there consolation,\nin the music
  of others and in others’ poems.\nOnly others save us,\neven though solitude taste
  like\nopium. The others are not hell,\nif you see them early, with their \nforeheads
  pure, cleansed by dreams.\nThat is why I wonder what\nwould should be used, “he”
  or “you.” Every “he”\nis a betrayal of a certain “you” but \nin return someone else’s
  poem\noffers the fidelity of a sober dialogue."
