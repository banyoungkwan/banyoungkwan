<p>Milton Nascimento :&nbsp;<span style="font-family:AppleGothic;">Courage (1969)</span></p>
<p>01. Travessia (Bridges)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have crossed a thousand bridges</p>
<p class="p1">In my search for something real</p>
<p class="p1">There were great suspension bridges</p>
<p class="p1">Made like spiderwebs of steel</p>
<p class="p1">There were tiny wooden trestles</p>
<p class="p1">And there were bridges made of stone</p>
<p class="p1">I have always been a stranger</p>
<p class="p1">And I've always been alone</p>
<p class="p1">There's a bridge to tomorrow</p>
<p class="p1">There's a bridge from the past</p>
<p class="p1">There's a bridge made of sorrow</p>
<p class="p1">That I pray will not last</p>
<p class="p1">There's a bridge made of colors</p>
<p class="p1">In the sky high above</p>
<p class="p1">And I think that there must be</p>
<p class="p1">Bridges made out of love</p>
<p class="p1">I can see her in the distance</p>
<p class="p1">On the river's other shore</p>
<p class="p1">And her hands reach out in longing</p>
<p class="p1">As my own have done before</p>
<p class="p1">And I call across to tell her</p>
<p class="p1">Where I believe the bridge must lie</p>
<p class="p1">And I'll find it</p>
<p class="p1">Yes, I'll find it</p>
<p class="p1">If I search until I die</p>
<p class="p1">When the bridge is between us&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">We'll have nothing to fear</p>
<p class="p1">We will run through the sunlight</p>
<p class="p1">And I'll meet her halfway</p>
<p class="p1">There's a bridge made of colors</p>
<p class="p1">In the sky high above</p>
<p class="p1">And I'm certain that somewhere</p>
<p class="p1">There's a bridge made of love</p>
