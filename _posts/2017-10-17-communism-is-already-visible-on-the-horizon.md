> “Communism is already visible on the horizon,” declared Khrushchev in a speech.
Question from the floor:
“Comrade Khrushchev, what is a ‘horizon’?”
“Look it up in a dictionary,” replied Nikita Sergeevich.
At home the questioner found the following explanation in a reference work:
“Horizon, an apparent line separating the sky from the earth, which retreats as one approaches it.”
