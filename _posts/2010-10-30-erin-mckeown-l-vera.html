<blockquote> Oh vera i can't complain but <br /> when, when will you write? <br /> this city is strange and strangely bright<br /> sooner or later i'll change
<p>  Oh vera my cough is silent <br /> and Sunset is setting up fine <br /> there's work for me here <br /> and here is my work <br /> while we wait for my lungs to dry  </p>
<p>  Oh vera tonight i'm lost<br /> what makes me live for this craft?<br /> I'm going nowhere <br /> my music's a bust<br /> even our neighbors just laugh</p>
<p>  Oh vera we must see a film<br /> I think that it might change my life<br /> something with garland<br /> who's down on her luck<br /> the kind of picture i like  </p>
<p>  Oh vera i'm full of it now <br /> who knew that notes could be fun? <br /> I'm counting to 12 and <br /> then back to one<br /> I feel i'm a writer again </p>
<p>  Oh vera i'm truly content<br /> I'm waiting alone for a friend <br /> a helluva poet a hollywood type<br /> who turns up the words on their end </p>
<p>  Oh vera i'm reading the news<br /> I can do nothing but cry <br /> The opera was summer <br /> an apple just fell <br /> it's funny how well poets lie.</p></p>
