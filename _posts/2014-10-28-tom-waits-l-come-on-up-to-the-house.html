<div>Well the moon is broken<br />
And the sky is cracked<br />
Come on up to the house<br />
The only things that you can see<br />
Is all that you lack<br />
Come on up to the houseAll your cryin don't do no good<br />
Come on up to the house<br />
Come down off the cross<br />
We can use the wood<br />
Come on up to the house</p>
<p>Come on up to the house<br />
Come on up to the house<br />
The world is not my home<br />
I'm just a passin thru<br />
Come on up to the house</p>
<p>There's no light in the tunnel<br />
No irons in the fire<br />
Come on up to the house<br />
And your singin lead soprano<br />
In a junkman's choir<br />
You gotta come on up to the house</p>
<p>Does life seem nasty, brutish and short<br />
Come on up to the house<br />
The seas are stormy<br />
And you can't find no port<br />
Come on up to the house<br />
There's nothin in the world</p>
<p><i>[Chorus]</i></p>
<p>There's nothin in the world<br />
that you can do<br />
you gotta come on up to the house<br />
and you been whipped by the forces<br />
that are inside you<br />
come on up to the house<br />
well you're high on top<br />
of your mountain of woe<br />
come on up to the house<br />
well you know you should surrender<br />
but you can't let go<br />
you gotta come on up to the house</p>
<p><i>[Chorus]</i></p>
</div>
