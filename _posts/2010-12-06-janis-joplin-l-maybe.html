<p>  Maybe<br /> Whoa, if I could ever hold your little hand<br /> Oh you might understand.<br /> Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, yeah.</p>
<p>  Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe dear<br /> I guess I might have done something wrong,<br /> Honey I'd be glad to admit it.<br /> Oh, come on home to me!<br /> Honey maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe yeah.</p>
<p>  Well I know that it just doesn't ever seem to matter, baby,<br /> Oh honey, when I go out or what I'm trying to do,<br /> Can't you see I'm still left here<br /> And I'm holding on in needing you.</p>
<p>  Please, please, please, please,<br /> Oh don't you reconsider babe.<br /> Now come on, I said come back,<br /> Won't you come back to me!</p>
<p>  Maybe dear, oh maybe, maybe, maybe,<br /> Let me help you show me how.<br /> Honey, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe,<br /> Maybe, maybe, maybe, yeah,<br /> Maybe, maybe, maybe, yeah.<br /> Ooh!</p>
