title: A friend of mine is an ethnomusicologist who spent several years studying the
  gamelan music of Central Java. He was trained in Western music in the States, and
  spent many years working on his own compositions and performing with other musicians.
  One of the most frustrating things about his studies in Java, he told me, was trying
  to work on specific parts of songs with the gamelan musicians. Once they were at
  a rehearsal, and after running through a piece, he asked them to play only a section
  from the middle so that he could make sure he got all the notes right. This proved
  to be an impossible request. After a lot of hemming and hawing, excuses, and several
  false starts, he realized that the group just could not do it. They insisted on
  playing the entire piece over again, from beginning to end. In Java, the music was
  learned by rote, from many years of observation and imitation, not from written
  notation. The idea of taking a small part out of context, or playing just a few
  bars, simply did not exist. The music was learned and conceived as a whole in the
  minds of the musicians.
