<p>Sun Kil Moon : April<br />01. Lost Verses
<p>
<p>I came out from under her warm sheets<br />Into the brisk late October<br />If only for one last hope<br />I wanted my time with you to be over
<p>I'm staring up into the sky<br />While all the raining is pouring down<br />I'm reaching out for your help<br />But evil beings hold me backwards
<p>All shapes and shadows move in and out<br />And hover round my bed<br />Voices arrive and disappear<br />I want to talk to them
<p>Darkness disintegrates<br />I'm rising; I'm rising toward a light<br />A light leading over hills and meadows
<p>I've risen up from the dead<br />With the burning leaves of autumn<br />If only for one last chance<br />That all of whom have been defeated<br />To put on my father's wool coat<br />To smell my mother's fragrances and perfumes<br />To find my young brothers and sisters<br />To never leave or let them go
<p>Houses adorned so beautifully<br />The Marin headlands song<br />Lost verses well up my eyes and ears<br />The lone mandolin strums<br />On Tamalpais warm spring<br />The many places we<br />Lay down in sleepy hidden shadows
<p>I see you well and clear<br />Deep in the moonlight dear<br />Your radiant august eyes<br />They are the suns that rise<br />They are the light that blinds<br />They end these lost verses
<p>I came up from under the ocean<br />Evaporated sea salt water<br />A mist above the skyline<br />I haunt the streets of San Francisco<br />Watch over loved ones and old friends<br />I see them trough their living room windows<br />Shaken by fear and worries<br />I want them to know how I love them so<br />Foghorns would sound in waking<br />Is it my voice you hear?<br />Footsteps are moving across the floor<br />And you know I'm here<br />The afternoon carries up from the hills and you are well and near<br />To fall into the light I follow
<p>I feel oh so near<br />When morning doves appear<br />And ghosts of April ring<br />Echo the refrain<br />Soon finding a place<br />In these lost verses
<p>They fill the foggy day<br />They hide the hills away<br />That steal our time<br />They are the picturesque night<br />The casting city lights<br />On the bay flowing into the ocean glowing</p></p></p></p></p></p></p>
