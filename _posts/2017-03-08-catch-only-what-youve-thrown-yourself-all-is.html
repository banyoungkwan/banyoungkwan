  Catch only what you’ve thrown yourself, all is
  mere skill and little gain;
  but when you’re suddenly the catcher of a ball
  thrown by an eternal partner
  with accurate and measured swing
  towards you, to your center, in an arch
  from the great bridgebuilding of God:
  why catching then becomes a power—
  not yours, a world’s.
