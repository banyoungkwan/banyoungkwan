<blockquote>Why me?"
<p>"That is a very <span style="font-style:italic;">Earthling</span> qustion to ask, Mr. Pilgrim. Why <span style="font-style:italic;">you</span>? Why <span style="font-style:italic;">us</span> for that matter? Why <span style="font-style:italic;">anything</span>? Because this moment simply <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">is</span>. Have you ever seen bugs trapped in amber?"</p>
<p>"Yes" Billy, in fact, had a paperweight in his office which was a blob of polished amber with three ladybugs embedded in it. </p>
<p>"Well, here we are, Mr. Pilgrim, trapped in the amber of this moment. There is no why."</p>

<p>"All time is all time. It does not change. It does not lend itself to warning or explanations. It simply <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">is. </span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>Take it moment by moment, and you will find that we are all, as I've said before, bugs in amber."</p>
