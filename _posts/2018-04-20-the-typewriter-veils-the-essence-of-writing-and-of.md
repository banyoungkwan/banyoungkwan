> The typewriter veils the essence of writing and of the script. It withdraws from man the essential rank of the hand, without man’s experiencing this withdrawal appropriately and recognizing that it has transformed the relation of Being to his essence. The typewriter is a signless cloud, i.e., a withdrawing concealment in the midst of its very obtrusiveness. and through it the relation of Being man is transformed. It is, in fact, signless, not showing itself as to its essence; perhaps that is why most of you, as is proven to me by your reaction, though well-intended, have not grasped what I have been trying to say.

—Martin Heidegger in Parmenides (1992), p. 85
