<p>  - even if i try so hard<br /> would we still be coming to an end<br /> even if we spoke the same words<br /> would we still return as friends<br /> even if its simple from the start<br /> we will give the pieces of the heart<br /> and when there is nothing left to pretend<br /> we will know its coming to an end
<p>  even if we try so hard<br /> we will give pieces of our heart<br /> its always good to see you again<br /> even if its coming to an end</p></p></p>
